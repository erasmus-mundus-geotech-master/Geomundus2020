			<p>
			This is a competition that allows participants to showcase their work with the world and share their brilliant ideas and findings. The competition 
			is open worldwide (to registrants) and is aligned with the 12th edition of Geomundus conference which is to be held as a Digital Conference this year. 
			The theme for this year’s Mapathon is : Mapping our future on Earth. Three categories can be visualised:

			<p> We believe these are relevant issues and that creative liberty can be taken to make both attractive and informative maps! </p>
			<p>
			The Geomundus Mapathon competition is open to all students and recent graduates (at most in 2020) who have registered for Geomundus 2020. 
			Share your research results or map an issue that you feel deserves more recognition, we are looking forward to each kind of submission. 
			As cartographers, you have the freedom to visualise and portray any of the above issues on a map. Map your story of the COVID-19 experience, 
			or share the efforts of your country in response to the corona outbreak, an interesting phenomenon resulting from our changing climate 
			or a new visualization technique for renewable energy. Maps are useful to bring awareness to oft ignored and underrepresented issues like 
			renewable energy transition and climate change.

            </header>

            <p>
		 Geomundus Mapathon intends to promote digital map production and the use of typical map elements. Submission will be in the form of a pdf document 
		    of your map product which should be of A3 size (landscape or portrait). Please see the Mapathon Submission Guidelines and Mapathon 
		    Evaluation Rubric for more information. 
            </p>
		<p>
			The challenge for you is to develop a map with all relevant map elements, illustrating the information you would like to highlight or bring awareness 
			to. There are two groups: individual and group (maximum 3 members). The selected winners will receive prizes from a pool of 825 Euros (in the 
			form of Paypal gift cards).

            <p>
		Although these maps are not under the mentioned themes, we have added them to give guidance as they are aesthetically pleasing and exemplify 
		    requisite elements that maps should have. 
            </p>

	     <p>
		The above map was made given the prompt of showing the difference between normalized and raw population data. Classification methods can be elusive 
		     and the map design was encouraged to be Japan-centric. Some stereotypes of what this meant were extrapolated but of course the overall design was 
		     aesthetically pleasing and informative. 
             </p>
	    <img src="images/website_logo.png" style="vertical-align: middle; margin: 2%;" alt="" height="150" width="150" />
	    <p>For the above map, students were encouraged to build a children’s map that divided a certain region based on some characteristics. The watercolour style 
		    available from ESRI by John Nelson was the foundation for these maps. There are many different styles and customizations that you can leverage, 
		    even outside of using ArcGIS. We encourage you to explore your options and let the creative juices flow! </p>

	    <p>The final sample visualized elevation data from Mexico overlaid with a futuristic space theme. Of course apart from the mapping, some graphic design tools 
		    and software were used to achieve this result. A very impressive map that combined a space theme with elevation data to draw in the audience and map 
		    some interesting features. <p>
