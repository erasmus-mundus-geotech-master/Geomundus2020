			    in (inter)national projects in the agriculture and development sectors of several countries (e.g. Australia, China, Ethiopia, Germany, Mexico, 
			    and the UK). As a researcher, he developed RS and GIS tools for precision and conservation agriculture, digital soil mapping, and environmental 
			    monitoring during his Post-Doc (Newcastle University, UK) and Ph.D. studies (GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Germany), and consultancy 
			    activities (CIMMYT, Mexico). For instance, to optimize farm management, Gerald developed an easy-to-use tool for deriving yield zones in crop 
			    production system by applying Spatio-temporal analysis to large yield map time series using image analysis techniques such as pattern recognition 
			    and unsupervised learning. As a GIS expert (GIZ German agency of international cooperation, Germany; SEMARNAT, Mexico) he built and managed a GIS

		            <p align="justify"> Wheat rusts pose a major threat to food security in Ethiopia, with several devastating epidemics in recent history. 
				    To help prevent major disease outbreaks, early detection and timely control are essential. In response to the wheat rust problem
				    in Ethiopia, a consortium of national and international partners have created one of the most advanced, operational crop disease 
				    early warning and advisory systems in the world. This early warning system includes several advanced technologies and operates in 
				    near real-time within the wheat season. Key elements include near real-time field and mobile phone surveillance data, mobile nanopore 
				    sequencing diagnostics, meteorologically-driven spore dispersal, disease environmental suitability forecasting, and a platform for timely 
				    communication to policy-makers, extension agents and small-holder farmers. This keynote talk describes the existing early warning system 
				    and the planned development of additional, new components for enhancement based on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and remote 
				    sensing, such as UAV-based high throughput phenotyping for biotic stresses.

                OFFIS Institute for Information Technology Oldenburg and the Center for Sustainable Spatial Development in Oldenburg (ZENARiO). He serves currently as chair of the Society of Geoinformatics in Northern Germany (GiN) and as a member of
                several program committees.<br /> His main research and teaching interest is the management of spatial data. Thomas Brinkhoff studied computer science at the University of Bremen. He received his doctoral degree from the Ludwig-Maximilians-University
                of Munich for his work on efficient processing of spatial joins in spatial database system. Before his current position, he worked as a project manager on Geographic Information System (GIS) solutions for traffic information and emergency
                services.
                <br /> Thomas Brinkhoff wrote the first German textbook about spatial database system, which is currently published in the third edition. His network-based generator of moving objects has been used by several hundreds of publications as
                a benchmark for spatiotemporal data structures and algorithms. He also runs a popular website that is based on georeferenced population data.<br/> His current works are related to the management and analysis of spatial sensor data and
                of data from Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) projects. He was significantly involved in the development of the master course “Spatial Information Science” in Oldenburg that offers three specializations; one of them is the analysis
                of spatial data.<br />

                The question “What is special about spatial?” has been asked for decades. Do we really need special solutions for handling geospatial data? Having this question in mind, the talk will discuss several previous and current challenges in spatial data management
                and their (possible) solutions.

                During his talk, Tim will reflect on the significance of GeoSpatial data and tools for society and question whether GIS is "ours" or "theirs". This talk is also known as the "did I spend 17 years of my life making tools that people don´t need?" and "are you about to spend the next 17 years of your life making tools that people don´t need?" talk. My talk will maybe be a little different from what you are used to for a keynote...we will poke fun at ourselves and look for bright lights of hope in a world that sometimes seems bleak and lacking in promise.

                GIS has been for decades a very specialized field strongly dedicated to specific domains such as urban planning or environment. GIS experts represent a rich group of diverse professional skills and profiles who have work together to merge diverse disciplines
                such as cartography, topography, design or IT technologies. Far from the big audiences, GIS have been watching the mainstream IT progress from certain distance, making us wonder what was special about spatial. Now, this trend seems to
                have changed. IT mainstream has realized the power of maps, and any IT technology is looking into maps for flashy visualizations, smart analysis, new functionalities. When everybody needs a map in their life, it is the turn of the geospatial
                experts... make it happen!
