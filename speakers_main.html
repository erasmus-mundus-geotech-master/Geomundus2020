	        and the Principal Investigator of the Geospatial Statistics and Health Surveillance Research Group. Paula received her Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and her Ph.D. degree in Statistics from the University of Valencia, 
		    and her Master's degree in Biostatistics from Harvard University. Prior to joining KAUST, she held academic positions at the University of Bath, Lancaster University, Queensland University of Technology, London 
		    School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Harvard School of Public Health.
                services.
                <br /> Paula's research focuses on the development of innovative statistical methods and computational tools for geospatial data analysis 
		    	and health surveillance and has directly informed strategic policy in reducing disease burden in several countries. Her projects 
		    	include the development of modeling architectures to understand the spatio-temporal patterns and identify targets for intervention
		    	of malaria in Africa, leptospirosis in Brazil, and cancer in Australia. Paula has also worked on the development of a number of 
		    	R packages for Bayesian risk modeling, detection of disease clusters, and risk assessment of travel-related spread of disease, and 
		    	is the author of Spatial EpiApp, a Shiny web application for the analysis of spatial and spatio-temporal disease data. Paula has 
		    	published extensively in leading journals and is the author of the book 'Geospatial Health Data: Modeling and Visualization with 
		    	R-INLA and Shiny' (2019, Chapman & Hall/CRC).<br />

		            <p align="justify"> Geospatial health data are essential to inform public health and policy. These data can be used to quantify disease burden, 
			understand geographic and temporal patterns, identify risk factors, and measure inequalities. In this talk, Paula will give an overview of her research which 
			focuses on the development of innovative statistical methods and interactive visualization applications for geospatial data analysis and health 
			surveillance.

                    <a class="link_keynote" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerald-blasch/" target="_blank"><strong> Dr. Gerald Blasch </strong></a> Gerald Blasch is a Crop 
			    Disease Geo-Spatial Data Scientist at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT). His work focuses on R4D of remote sensing (RS)
			    and geospatial solutions for large-scale crop disease early warning systems, whereby he explores the potential of UAV-based high-throughput 
			    phenotyping for biotic stresses and satellite-based crop disease detection. 

                <br /> Overall, Gerald has 13 years of research and consultancy experience 
			    in (inter)national projects in the agriculture and development sectors of several countries (e.g. Australia, China, Ethiopia, Germany, Mexico, 
			    and the UK). As a researcher, he developed RS and GIS tools for precision and conservation agriculture, digital soil mapping, and environmental 
			    monitoring during his Post-Doc (Newcastle University, UK) and Ph.D. studies (GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Germany), and consultancy 
			    activities (CIMMYT, Mexico). For instance, to optimize farm management, Gerald developed an easy-to-use tool for deriving yield zones in crop 
			    production system by applying Spatio-temporal analysis to large yield map time series using image analysis techniques such as pattern recognition 
			    and unsupervised learning. As a GIS expert (GIZ German agency of international cooperation, Germany; SEMARNAT, Mexico) he built and managed a GIS 
			    for waste management for the Mexican Federal Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT).<br />

		            <p align="justify"> Wheat rusts pose a major threat to food security in Ethiopia, with several devastating epidemics in recent history. 
				    To help prevent major disease outbreaks, early detection and timely control are essential. In response to the wheat rust problem
				    in Ethiopia, a consortium of national and international partners have created one of the most advanced, operational crop disease 
				    early warning and advisory systems in the world. This early warning system includes several advanced technologies and operates in 
				    near real-time within the wheat season. Key elements include near real-time field and mobile phone surveillance data, mobile nanopore 
				    sequencing diagnostics, meteorologically-driven spore dispersal, disease environmental suitability forecasting, and a platform for timely 
				    communication to policy-makers, extension agents and small-holder farmers. This keynote talk describes the existing early warning system 
				    and the planned development of additional, new components for enhancement based on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and remote 
				    sensing, such as UAV-based high throughput phenotyping for biotic stresses.
